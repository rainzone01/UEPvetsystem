 * view (presentation) in the MVC architecture. The controller contains 
 * methods that define actions such as fetching data, performing logic, 
 * and returning views to the user. By organizing code in controllers, 
 * Laravel encourages clean, maintainable, and reusable code, separating 
 * the application's logic from routes and views.
