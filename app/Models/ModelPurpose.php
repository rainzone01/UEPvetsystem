 * The Model is the one that represents a specific 
 * entity in the database. In Laravel's MVC architecture, models act as 
 * an intermediary between the application and the database. This model 
 * provides an easy way to interact with the database, allowing you to 
 * retrieve, insert, update, or delete records from a database table. 
 * By using Eloquent ORM, Laravel's built-in database management system, 
 * you can work with database records as if they were objects, making it 
 * simpler to manage data and perform queries without having to write raw SQL.
